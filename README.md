## Installation

To run this page on your local machine or access development simply install the html and assets folders into a directory.

## Usage

When the user clicks the start quiz button, a timer engages, and the first question answer compilation is displayed.
When an answer is selected, the selected answer will display green on a correct answer or red on an incorrect answer.
When an incorrect answer is selected the timer will drop 5 additional seconds.
When a correct answer is selected the user score will go up. 
When the final quesion is answered the display will show the users score as a percentage, and a form to input the users initials will save their score for the next time they take the quiz.
If the final question is not answered before the timer ends the display will show a button that says 'try again'
